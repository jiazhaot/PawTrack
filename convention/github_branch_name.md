# github branch conventions:

## brief:

- main:

  - all the docs & code in main should be stable and believable
  - do not make any PR to main
  - every release will base on main

- develop:
  - every new feature should be developed base on this branch
  - when all work in a sprint complete, develop will merge into main
- docs/anyrandomname
  - every docs change need to rename the develop (remember to fetch the lastest) into a new branch like this
  - when you complete your work, make a PR, merge this branch into develop
  - branch name as your wish
- feat/anyrandomname
  - every feature change need to rename the develop (remember to fetch the lastest) into a new branch like this
  - when you complete your work, make a PR, merge this branch into develop
  - branch name as your wish

## examples:

- docs/FirstMeetingNote
